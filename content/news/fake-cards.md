## 🕵️ How to Identify Counterfeit Secret Lair Cards

Counterfeit Magic cards are becoming more advanced each year,  
especially for high-value drops like *Angels* or *Phyrexian Faves*.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Authentication
1. **Texture Test** – Real cards have micro-textured matte finish.  
2. **Light Test** – Shine a flashlight through: fakes show uneven glow.  
3. **Black Light Check** – Real cards reveal a subtle blue hue under UV.  
4. **Print Dot Test** – Real cards use Rosette pattern printing (look under magnifier).

### 🧰 Recommended Tools
- Jeweler's loupe (10x)  
- UV flashlight  
- Digital scale (real cards weigh ~1.74g)

### 🚫 Red Flags
- Too glossy surface  
- Incorrect fonts or saturated blacks  
- Mismatched collector numbers  

### ✅ Final Advice
If in doubt, compare with an official image from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com)  
or consult MTG community verification threads on Reddit.
