## 💰 Are Secret Lairs Still a Good Investment?

When Secret Lair debuted in 2019, many questioned their long-term value.  
Today, they've become one of *Magic: The Gathering*'s most profitable collectible lines.

### 📈 Price Performance Snapshot
| Drop | Average ROI | Time Since Release |
|------|--------------|--------------------|
| Secret Lair: Phyrexian Faves | +42% | 6 months |
| Secret Lair: Secret Scare | +28% | 5 months |
| Secret Lair: Angels | +15% | 9 months |

### 🔍 What Makes a Drop Valuable?
1. **Exclusive artwork** from high-profile illustrators.  
2. **Crossover IPs** (like *Jurassic World*) that attract new buyers.  
3. **Low print runs** — scarcity drives aftermarket growth.

### ⚠️ Collector Warnings
Avoid hype-driven purchases. Some drops (e.g. meme themes) may fall below MSRP after release.

### ✅ Final Verdict
Secret Lair cards **can be a strong long-term collectible**,  
but only if you buy selectively — focus on iconic characters and unique art.
