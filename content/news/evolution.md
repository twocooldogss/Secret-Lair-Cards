## 📜 How Secret Lair Changed Magic Forever

Launched in late 2019, Secret Lair started as a quirky experiment —  
limited art reprints sold directly by Wizards of the Coast.  
Six years later, it's a pillar of MTG's collectible identity.

### 🕹️ The Key Eras
- **2019–2020:** Experimental beginnings, artist-driven drops.  
- **2021–2022:** Crossover explosion (*Stranger Things*, *Walking Dead*).  
- **2023–2024:** Art as investment – the "collector renaissance."  
- **2025:** Premium finish and serialized editions.

### 🌍 Community Impact
Secret Lair connected Magic's art community, player base, and investors.  
It blurred the line between collectible art and gameplay utility.

### 🧭 What's Next
Rumors suggest AI-assisted "Artist Remix" drops and physical NFTs.  
Wizards continues to push the boundaries of collectible design.
